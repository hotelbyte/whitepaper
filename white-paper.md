# Introduction
## If you are a hotel...
Try to imagine the **full control on room rate**, the full price adjustment no matter the intermediaries commissions, capacity to create your own website of sales, the hotel position based on real experiences and not depending on negotiations for demanding contracts with integration or reservation platforms and free!

If you want to be the first to innovate, if you want to take the control of your services without depending on demanding negotiations with integration platforms, pricing control, time to market, etc., if you want to get a real reviews about the experiences of your guests, or simply you are exclusive and luxurious, this is your project!

## If you are a end user...
Tired of paying more for hotels that later are not good or services that you think are worth less, the result of conventional companies that want to profit at the expense of your experience or new blockchain companies promising something for nothing, just offering a token outside our platform, don't you believe them. 
A company wants money, that's why **we are here**, to create a new hotel sales model, a new model for buying hotel reservations, made to your specifications, with your participation.

So, what is the reason to have five different room rates for the same hotel, if at the end you are going to enjoy in the same way? This is not supply and demand, it is a succulent business that does nothing but hide the most important thing that is the hotel experience, with real added value and not by commissions resulting from negotiations and monopolies of the biggest players in this sector.

We want you to have more than one price per room, yes! But we want this due to one room offers massage and the other room does not, for example!

If you want to purchase a hotel service and pay for a real service, without hidden fees, without wasting time saving money, besides having a voice and vote, this is your project.

**This is your project, your foundation, your community**.

## If you are an intermediary (B2B)...
Integration platforms, bed banks, travel agencies, etc., they are ending their days if they do not adapt and change their philosophy. So join to us to make great things, you will became in a service provider with master nodes!

The hotel distribution models based on volume and/or commissions on the same product, are old fashion. Now the world tends increasingly to transparency and fair distribution of goods and services.

But even so, there are ways to maximize profits from this new hotel model and we will be happy to work with you. So if you want to get into this revolution, this is your project.

So remember, we are an innovative platform nothing to do with ICO, TOKEN or anything about that.

# Problem to Solve
Simple, you waste your time to find the best hotel for you, you waste your money too. Hotels waste their money with a lot of intermediaries, platforms, pricing, what to tell you, you know it.
Our professionals are here, keep calm you will be more happy!

### Note
If you are an end user and you don't want to read about the hotel functionalities you can jump to the `End Users` section.

# Hotels
**This section explains how the hotels going to benefit from this innovative business model.**

## What's in it for the Hotels?
In one word: Blockchain. Thats means lower prices, no contracting processes, no billing periods = **more conversion rates (ROI) and more money to spend in a real hotel services**.

Thanks to Blockchain technology we can provide a business model with no added fees (only the transaction itself) and with a real potential for increasing visibility based on real experiences, as well as an immediate update of search results, increasing profits and striving to improve your service and not in negotiating demanding contracts with integrations.

In addition, the feared overbooking and delayed billing synchronizations with intermediaries disappear, as the hotel receives the money instantly, the litigation with the platforms are running out.

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/pricing_process_availability.png">
	<br>
	<b>Pricing model</b> - High level of pricing process, just in 3 steps.
</p>
<br>

Therefore we could list some of the key points you will achieve with this project:
 + Cost savings in SEO positioning and system scalability platforms.
 + No more commercial litigation due to reservation errors.
 + No more billing cycles with third parties.
 + Improvement of the quality of your service to obtain experiences validated by your hotel.
 + Control and improvement on the hotel SEO positioning.
 + The safeguarding of hotel reservation sensitive data in a private Blockchain.
 + And last but not least, all the advantages of Blockchain, fault tolerance, redundancy, etc.

## Product Loading
Now that you know a little about the concept of the idea, let's practice: I'm a hotel and I sell rooms and services. And now that I have to do? How do I present my product to the rest of the world?

Well, the answer is very simple, using an interface called **DHI**, distributed hotel interface. DHI will allow you to internally upload your product in real time or with a minimum propagation time (special dates such as summer campaigns, etc.)
When we refer to power internally upload, we mean that the DHI interface can be executed directly on a computer in your hotel or hotel chain, or if you prefer you can host it on your own servers.
With this DHI interface, we want to standardize the way to load the product onto the Blockchain, simplifying the interfaces and customizing those modules of the hotel chain.

## Pricing
Next steps! Now we have loaded product, but we are messing something very important: What´s about the price? What's about the hotel campaigns or promotions? What's about the booking cancellations?
In the DHI interface, you will be able to define everything related with pricing.
How does DHI interface pricing work? You will define a base price from which the rest of the characteristics are subtracted or added.

An example from the infinite variants:
+ Room X with base price of 89 € 
+ % taxes, fees, etc., 15% taxes, 13.35 € 
+ % promotions, campaigns, 10% promotion, 8.9 € 
+ % cancellations, 100%
+ Calculated sales price 93.45 €
+ Cancellation price 93.45 €

## Room Availability
It is important to understand how your hotel will be positioned in front of other competence hotels. The Blockchain will be feed through real validated user experiences. With these validated experiences your hotel will be positioned in the Blockchain. Here we are showing the main variables that will be taken into account in the hotel positioning:
+ User experiences
+ Cancellation rate
+ Images and information provided
+ Booking rate

These hotel experiences are collected once the user has enjoyed the hotel experience. As a reward of the hotel experience provided, the user receives Hotelcoins.

## Booking
Now we have the product loaded, as well as the price, promotions and policies of cancellation and positioning.
As a hotel chain, you will be able to have one or n Hotelbyte addresses to receive Hotelcoin payments.

### Booking Cancellation
In your product loading you will define your cancellation policies.

## How to participate
### Beta Phase
In order to join us you just have to contact us via email **partners@hotelbyte.org**, indicating a date and a place (a virtual conference if possible) and we will respond you immediately to arrange a meeting with the contacts you specify us.

We have defined in our roadmap a beta phase to be able to work with hotel chains. With the aim of nourishing the project with real hotel product. And show the project in a practical way.

In addition, in this beta phase the hoteliers (receptionists, etc.) and end users will have a tool to be able to expose all their improvements and report any problem detected in the process. (We are thinking in a **zendesk**)

### Guarantee
The hotel has to be willing to offer a guarantee in case of exception, to guarantee the service to the user and with the sale of the same. For this, it will be specified directly with the hotel or hotel chain's address to define the best option for all.

# End Users
As a user and as a consumer of hotel bookings, you will take advantage of not having to do endless searches or not having to take Byzantine decisions. In addition to being able to write your experience directly to the hotel, the quality of the hotel offered will increase and you will be rewarded immediately.
That is, if you are looking for good prices, with this project you will be able to obtain them, and if the price does not matter to you but what the service is the important for you, also, **sign up for the Hotelbyte movement**!

## Mobile App
We are working in the mobile app to bring to you the best search experience in the Blockchain. Please be patient we going to update this section with screens.

Remember don't trust in any company that tries to sell to you a business they always will need profit of each booking, the company without profit it's a smoke, we are **The Hotel's Blockchain Foundation, we are the Hotelbyte Foundation** we are unique join us.

# Intermediaries
If you are an intermediary, your role in the final phase of this project, with the current business model, it is no longer needed. But as a Blockchain hotel foundation we want the transition to be for everyone, therefore we study different concepts to take part of the conversion:

**Step 1**: Hotel migration with direct contracts with the intermediary to the Blockchain
This migration would have a commission for the intermediary that would be reduced gradually (creating a token in our network).

**Step 2**: Adhesion to the foundation as an active part. You, as an intermediary, that have the experience and production capacity, can join the foundation to expand this technology. Either providing power to build private Blockchain networks for each hotel chain, or helping to maintain and make progress the hotel booking interfaces. Your reward / benefit will be studied according to each case and contribution. But think that you could convert yourself and you could be benefited, simply by maintaining a healthy network for the hotel to sell and positioning your networks that are the best, etc.

The final objective is that the intermediaries will convert themselves, providing creativity and power to the foundation. Creating an ecosystem where we all work to provide added value, and the prices will be in charged by the owners of the hotels!

## What will happen with TTOO, travel agencies, etc.?
The goal of this project is to break drastically with the current hotel booking model. But we are aware that such a change is very complicated due to the strength of the current hotel industry.
For this reason, the TTOO and travel agencies need to see this project as an evolution in the hotel business and reconvert themselves. This reconversion may take several years, and surely there is a lot of skepticism and there is a lot of people who do not want to participate. This is a normal situation, due to they are currently earning a lot of money, we are aware that we are talking about multi-million dollar businesses. But they are at risk of losing these multi-million dollar businesses if they ignore this project. Through this project we want to give hotels what they need and hotels will start to have more competitive prices and better experiences. Therefore we encourage you to join and collaborate to create a new future in the industry.

## How to participate
### Beta Phase
In order to join us you just have to contact us via email **partners@hotelbyte.org**, indicating a date and a place (a virtual conference if possible) and we will respond you immediately to arrange a meeting with the contacts you specify us.
Let's sit down together, let's talk, we can offer more to the world!

# Hotelcoin - HBF
Hotelcoin (HBF), is the cryptocurrency that we have defined to move transactions in our new network. Therefore the equivalent of ETH in this network will be HBF.

So we want to keep it an easy concept:
+ We aren’t a TOKEN, we are a PLATFORM, like Ethereum!
+ You need a new address for the HBF, your Ethereum address here is not exists.

We are providing a smart platform and standards for the booking hotels in the Blockchain, but we don't want to forget the fast payments and the cotization value for the booking hotels. The idea is quite simple.

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/hbf-flow.png">
	<br>
	<b>Hotelcoin flow</b> - Miners wins, expends, buys or sells HBF, Users expends, buys or sells HBF, Hotels expends, buys or sells HBF.
</p>
<br>

Today exists a lot of tokens thanks to Ethereum platform and many companies are betting to create tokens to solve problems or changing some business models, but this focus will go to be in a big problem, we can't delegate all the business in a one network, for that our platform is a fork of Ethereum network. We are working to become in the unique entity for the hotels in the blockchain for help them.

## Max. supply
No initial max. supply, We are crazy? nope, we follow the **Ethereum** practices to our coin, because the main value of our project is our smart platform and our tools not just our coin. But don't worry, we are open to introduce the **PoS** consensus algorithm, this one could help us to limit the supply a lot. So, mine Hotelcoins or buy while you can.

### Will this cycle of supply and demand be enough?
Without your participation there is no revolution, but to guarantee the continuous flow, it is imperative that the hotel provide rewards to its users. This reward can be in the form of promotions, exchange of written user experiences or hotel recommendations to other potential users.

This point is one of the premises of the **DHI** when loading a hotel product or when obtaining the profit of the booked room.

# Miners
## Why to mine this coin?
Because without your support this community doesn't have sense, don't worry about the future **PoS** implementation this isn't planned yet, anyway you can mine now to hold in the future.
Another thing to mine our coin is that with this coin you could do booking hotels and hotel services like a massages :)

## Guarantee
You are the key, if you support us you will get a real value for our coin, for now we are in one exchange, but we need your help to get more users and get more exchanges. If you believe in this project you can to launch to the moon.

## Pools
We are in many pools, that you can find here [Mining pools](https://explorer.hotelbyte.org/pools). 
If you have a pool and you want to add our mineable cryptocurrency you need to keep just this words:

+ **Hotelcoin** as name of our coin
+ **HBF** as acronym of our coin
+ **Hotelbyte** as platform that you are contributing with your pool
+ **Ethash or Dagger** Algorithm, like **Ethereum**
+ **13s** Block time
+ **9 HBF** as reward per block
+ [Link to our explorer to find miners or blocks](https://explorer.hotelbyte.org)

## PoW
We are in **PoW** mode with 9 HBF rewards per block, with 13 seconds as average resolution time per block. We are planning to create a good way to introduce the **PoS** consensus algorithm, but this isn't planned yet, before that we need to expanse our network a lot.

## PoS
Proof Of Stake, read this one to get more information about this consensus algorithm: [PoS documents](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ)
So you know what is the **PoS** consensus algorithm, ok... 

### When to come here?
This consensus algorithm isn't planned yet, stay tuned and keep in mind to hold more **Hotelcoins** for your future rewards.

# Master Nodes
The master node is a trusted node to guarantee the Hotelbyte network for your hotel bookings. As a miner, or as an intermediary you could run a master node to get rewards for your node keeping a robust network.
The technical details going to be available in the Q3/2018, please see our roadmap for more information about the release date.

## Why is good a master node?
The intermediaries will become in a master nodes. Do you imagine thousend of master nodes guaranteeing **the Hotelbyte network** for your bookings?, sounds great, for that we need to convert the intermediaries in a master node service provider, it's the begin of the revolution inside of the B2B services.

# Roadmap
[Read here our roadmap](https://hotelbyte.org#roadmap), We are working on changes for the roadmap, please any doubt ask us before to sproud bad words ;) thank you.

# FAQ
Surely you have a lot of doubts and uncertainties that we will list below, anyway these questions can be found updated in our [FAQ](https://hotelbyte.org#faq), also we are working for the **Zendesk** site for your support.

+ **I find this project difficult because of the current size of the industry. How is it possible to make such a big change?**
	As any technological revolution has to be step by step, first we want to show you the concept, get into practice, and after that, we want to gather as much support as possible to expand this technology, if you help us now, tomorrow we will all win.

+ **As a hotel or hotel chain, do I have to invest a lot of capital?**
	DO NOT! You only need 4 things:
		+ Be willing to innovate and be among the first!
		+ Have the **DHI** installed in each hotel or on your own servers
		+ Load your hotel product in the **DHI**
		+ Have a wallet with Hotelcoin.
		
+ **It is not clear to me what I can win as a hotel?**
	So let's sit down together, let's talk about your concerns and faced problems and we will give you the best solution.

+ **The booking website that users will use, how will it be maintained, who will be responsible?**
	We have several plans for this web, being an open source initiative, anyone could start the same website and put their look and feel to start selling the hotels available on the network. Doing that has a cost that is shared directly between the hotel and the foundation to guarantee the maintainability of the network.
	+ Initial and medium term plan: The foundation will provide a DAPP.
Long-term plan: Hotels or intermediaries that want to support the foundation, can create their own DAPP based on our network providing them with more functionality or specializing.
	+ In any case, the foundation will be always the responsible and all its collaborators. As a hotel you will contribute indirectly by being connected to our network.

+ **What are Hotelcoins?**
Please read the HotelCoins section

+ **Will the customer's data be safe?**
	Yes, the hotel booking is never finalized in the public Blockchain, but it ends up being the private one of the hotel chain or hotel. This allows the transactions to be public but the private data is only accessible for the hotel chain or hotel.

+ **Is the payment transaction immediate?**
	It is immediate as long as the Hotelbyte network is healthy.

+ **If the DHI fails, what can I do?**
	There is a chat support and a FAQ to solve all your problems. DHI is a DAPP (distributed app) so the longer the number of hotels or servers you have with the private network running, the greater tolerance to failures.
